# *****RESTAURANT REVIEWS***** 


 ## App Design:
My chosen CRUD application was to make a restaurant reviewing application. Users can access the homepage and add a restaurant to be reviewed by others, or also add their own review, which can be either updated or deleted. 


Users are prompted to click one of three links:
 * Home 
 * Make a new review
 * Add a new Restaurant

Once they have added a review, their review will be displayed on the homepage, along with an update button and a delete button. At the bottom of the page, the name and cuisine type of all restaurants that are in the database are shown.

On day two of properly beginning my project, I have taken the time to create a kanban style board. This visually depicts my workload at a glance and allows me to keep track of what has already been done.
